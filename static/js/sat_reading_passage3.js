<p><b>ƒêo·∫°n vƒÉn:</b></p>
<p>
Bees play a vital role in pollination, transferring pollen from one flower to another.  
This process allows plants to reproduce and produce fruits.  
In recent years, scientists have raised concerns about declining bee populations,  
warning that this trend could threaten global food production.
