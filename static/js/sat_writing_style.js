<h3>✍️ SAT Writing – Style & Expression</h3>

<p><b>1. Nguyên tắc:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Ngắn gọn (Concise):</b> Tránh từ ngữ dư thừa.  
      Ví dụ: "At this point in time" → thay bằng "Now".</li>
  <li><b>Rõ ràng (Clarity):</b> Chọn cách diễn đạt dễ hiểu, tránh vòng vo.</li>
  <li><b>Chính xác (Precision):</b> Dùng từ đúng nghĩa, phù hợp ngữ cảnh.</li>
  <li><b>Phong cách trang trọng (Formal):</b> Tránh ngôn ngữ quá thân mật, viết như văn nói.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>2. Các lỗi thường gặp:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Dùng cụm từ dài dòng không cần thiết.</li>
  <li>Dùng từ không chính xác hoặc mơ hồ.</li>
  <li>Trộn lẫn giọng văn trang trọng và thân mật.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>3. Lưu ý:</b> Trên SAT Writing, luôn chọn câu trả lời <i>ngắn gọn, rõ ràng, tự nhiên và đúng ngữ cảnh</i>.</p>
