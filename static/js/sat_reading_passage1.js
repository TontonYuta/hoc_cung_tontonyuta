<h3>📖 SAT Reading – Passage 1: Literature</h3>

<p><b>Đoạn văn:</b></p>
<p>
On a quiet evening, Emma sat by the window, watching the rain slide down the glass.  
She held a letter from her friend, unopened, uncertain whether she wanted to read it.  
The silence of the room pressed on her, and the decision felt heavier than the paper in her hand.
